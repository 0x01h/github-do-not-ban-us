# Github Must Be a Free Platform

## Introduction

Github was a free platform for everyone since many years ago, but it has decided to restrict **Iranian accounts**.
I think living in a country is not a choice that you have, but being a developer and contributing to the open-source community is a choice. 
Github bans us from our freedom to contribute and being part of the open-source ecosystem because we are living in Iran.

**Github blocked our private repositories without any previous alert, and now we have no access to the codes**

You should not judge people based on their living country. You can restrict a government, but you should not ban your active and loyal users without any caution.

I think having a **simple Github page** is our fundamental right. 
Don't make us leave the open-source community.

Some of us have published packages that are used by other people that are not right to remove them.

## Note for GitHub
Please let us get a backup from our private repository before disabling them.

## What fellow devs can do?
Please spread the word by anymeans you can, to let everyone know and keep the Free Software "as in Free speech".
Specifically you can:
  - Star and share this repo on social platforms;
  - Change your github status to "Banned by Github for being Iranian ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡·", if you are affected by the restriction;
  - Change your avatar to the [Iranian Flag](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Flag_of_Iran.svg), or add a ribbon to show your support.
