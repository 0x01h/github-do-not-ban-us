# Github must be a free platform ...

## Introduction

Github was a free platform for everyone since many years ago but it has decided to ban Iranian accounts.
I think living in a country is not a choice that you have but beinging developer and contributing to open-source
environment is choice. Github ban us from our freedom to contribute and being part of open-source environment because
we are living in Iran.

I think is ok to ban Iranian from paied services but ban us from having a simple Github page is not right. I want to be a part
of open source projects ....

## Note
Please let us get a backup from our private repository before disabling them.
