# Github Must Be a Free Platform

## Introduction

Github was a free platform for everyone since many years ago but it has decided to ban `Iranian accounts`.
I think living in a country is not a choice that you have but being a developer and contributing to an open-source
environment is choice.

I think is ok to ban Iranian from paied services but banning us from having a `simple Github page` is not right. We want to be a part of the open source projects.

## Note for GitHub
Please let us get a backup from our private repository before disabling them.
